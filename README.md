## Functional Specification:
### Introduction

Gamers currently lack effective methods of locally organizing events and groups. Most gaming communities are distributed across the country or world and there is not an effective way of finding local gaming events and connecting with other gamers in the area. It is similarly hard for event organizers (campus organizations, city committees, etc.) to keep up with what games are popular in their area.

Our web app will address this problem by providing a platform for gamers to connect to other gamers in their area and host events for their community. It will provide information about the number of gamers in area, what games they are playing, and events that are being held.

### Points

*	Must allow users to create profiles with name, address, country, age, gender, description, and what games they are interested in playing
*	Must allow users to delete their own profiles
*	Must allow users to create connections with other users
*	Must allow users to see aggregate demographics for gamers in their area
*	Must allow users to lookup events within 50 miles of their location
*	Must allow users to create an event with a name, location, description, and time
*	Must allow users to delete events created by them
*	Must allow users to see all events created by their connections
*	Must allow users to see all events created by an individual connection
*	Must allow users to create comments linked to events
*	Must allow users to send messages to other users
*	Should allow players to create teams with other players dependent on game (ex. League of Legends – 5 player team, Super Smash Bros. Doubles – 2 player team)
*	Should allow players to declare characters/roles they play dependent on game
*	Should allow users to enter a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for all events
*	Could allow users to see rankings based on event performance (1st worth 5 points, 2nd worth 3 points, 3rd worth 1 point). Rankings could be broken down into top 10 in world rankings, country rankings, and local (within 50 miles) rankings. User’s should also be able to see their own rankings.
